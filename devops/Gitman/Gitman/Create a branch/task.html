<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>You'll continue to work with a program in the new <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch. This branch usually has the latest code version. When developers finish the current work and test all the changes, they merge this branch with the main one.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Be wary of deleting the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch. It should stay in the repository even after the merge because it's the stream of the latest changes; you can keep track of them<span style="color: #66cc66;">.</span></div>
<p>Follow the objectives and do not rush to merge with the main branch. You'll do it a few steps later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def main() -&gt; None:
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch using the <code class="language-python">git-flow</code> command or create it with plain git;</li>
<li>Update the content of the <code class="language-python">main.py</code> file to match the code block above;</li>
<li>Add changes to the staging area;</li>
<li>Commit the changes with the message <code class="language-python">Greet user by the name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can play around with the program running it as <code class="language-python">python main.py</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>Do not alter any other branches, and do not merge the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch with the main.</p>
