<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>We know you know what a file manager is. Remember Windows Explorer? You can view files and folders in a directory and navigate between folders using icons or by entering a directory path. </p>
<p>Our file manager will do the same things, but with one exception: it'll be a text-based manager, not a visual one. You'll control the manager with text commands instead of clicking on icons and interacting with menus â€” <em>so old school</em>. </p>
<p>Let's start with implementing the navigation feature. It enables us to go from one directory to another. In the later stages, we can perform some actions on files within these directories.</p>
<p>Your file manager should be able to execute the following commands: </p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">pwd</code> tells you in which directory you currently are</li>
<li><code class="java">cd</code> changes the current directory </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the <code class="java">cd</code> command can have the following attributes to specify in which directory the file manager should move to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">cd C:\folder1\folder2</code> moves from the current directory to the directory with the absolute path of <em>C:\folder1\folder2</em>. In other words, after this command is entered, the current directory should be changed to <em>folder2</em> located on disk <em>C:</em> inside <em>folder1</em>;</li>
<li><code class="java">cd ..</code> moves one directory up. That is if the current directory is <em>C:\folder1\folder2</em>, the current directory is changed to <em>C:\folder1;</em></li>
<li><code class="java">cd folder2</code> (when the user is in <code class="java">C:\folder1</code>) moves to the relative file path. The current directory should be changed to <code class="java">C:\folder1\folder2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the prompt message: <code class="java">Input the command</code></li>
<li>Take the command from the user. 
	<ul>
<li>If the command is <code class="java">pwd</code>, print the absolute path of the current directory. <br/>
		Note<strong>:</strong> The starting directory is the one where your file manager program is located. For example, if your file manager program has an absolute path <em>C:\Users\user\Projects\FileManager\manager.py</em>, and the first user command is <code class="java">pwd</code>, the file manager should print <code class="java">C:\Users\user\Projects\FileManager</code>.</li>
<li>If the command is <code class="java">cd ..</code>, move one level up from your current directory. Print the name of the new current folder.</li>
<li>If the command is <code class="java">cd path\path\path</code> (that is, <code class="java">cd</code> with a relative folder path), move to the folder specified by the user. Print the name of the new current folder.</li>
<li>If the user inputs any other command (including <code class="java">cd</code> with no arguments), print the error message: <code class="java">Invalid command</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep on taking new commands from the user until they type <code class="java">quit</code>. If the user types <code class="java">quit</code>, quit the program. </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input the command
&gt; pwd
C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\File Manager
&gt; cd ..
PycharmProjects
&gt; pwd
C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects
&gt; cd ..
User
&gt; pwd
C:\Users\User
&gt; cd C:\Users\Documents
Documents
&gt; cd C:\Users\Documents\Report
Report
&gt; cd ..
Documents
&gt; cd
Invalid command
&gt; ppp
Invalid command
&gt; pwd
C:\Users\Documents
&gt; quit</code></pre>
