summary: "<div><p>You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using\
  \ the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a\
  \ few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find\
  \ all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation,\
  \ but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation! In\
  \ this project, you will write your own\_programs to test data consistency and correctness.\
  \ You will practice reading documentation, working with data in JSON format, and\
  \ creating lists, iterators,\_and dictionaries. You will also learn how\_to work\
  \ with\_set methods, the\_<code>itertools</code>\_library, and the\_regular expression\
  \ library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/128?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
