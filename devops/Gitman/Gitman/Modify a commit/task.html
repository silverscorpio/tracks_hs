<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Good job, but it seems that we forgot to tell you that the program should have one more line of code. It'll be great if you could add this change to the latest commit in the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch and keep the same history of commits. Do you think you're ready for this task?</p>
<p>All you need to do is add a line that prints <code class="language-python">Nice to meet you</code> in the terminal. We'll provide you with the final program for this task. You can add the line by yourself or copy-paste the whole snippet to the <em>main.py</em> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def main() -&gt; None:
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    print("Nice to meet you!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to the content of the <code class="language-python">main.py</code> file as shown in the code block above;</li>
<li>Add changes to the staging area;</li>
<li>Edit the latest commit, and save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you've finished the task, the number of commits in your repository should stay the same. The commit message should remain the same too.</p>
<p>Do not forget that it is still a work in progress, so the <code class="language-python">main</code> branch should be left intact.</p>
